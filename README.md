# Wireframing
*Introduction*

Wireframing is a crucial step in the design process, serving as the skeletal outline or blueprint of a website or application. It's a low-fidelity representation that focuses solely on the layout, content hierarchy, and functionality, rather than visual aesthetics.

**Importance in Design**
 
* It helps designers and stakeholders visualize the arrangement of elements and how users will interact with the interface.
* It allows for early user testing and stakeholder feedback. 
* It provides developers with a solid understanding of the required functionality and layout, leading to more efficient and accurate coding.

# Key Elements of a Wireframe

**1. Layout Structure**
Defines the overall arrangement, grid, and sections of the page. It ensures visual balance and logical content grouping.
*Example: A header at the top, a sidebar for navigation, and a main content area.*

**2. Navigation**
Outlines how users move between pages (menus, links, buttons). Clear, intuitive navigation is vital for usability and helps users find information easily.
*Example: A persistent global navigation bar with clearly labeled menu items.*

**3. Content Placement**
Indicates where text, images, and forms will be located using placeholders. Strategic placement guides the user's eye and establishes visual hierarchy.
*Example: A prominent call-to-action button placed "above the fold" for immediate visibility.*

*84. Functionality**
Shows interactive elements and their basic behavior (buttons, forms, search fields). It ensures all necessary interactive features are included and helps map out user flows.
*Example: Input fields for an email and password, and a "Submit" button on a sign-up form.*
