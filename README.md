# Wireframing
*Introduction*

Wireframing is a crucial step in the design process, serving as the skeletal outline or blueprint of a website or application. It's a low-fidelity representation that focuses solely on the layout, content hierarchy, and functionality, rather than visual aesthetics.

**Importance in Design**
 
* It helps designers and stakeholders visualize the arrangement of elements and how users will interact with the interface.
* It allows for early user testing and stakeholder feedback. 
* It provides developers with a solid understanding of the required functionality and layout, leading to more efficient and accurate coding.
